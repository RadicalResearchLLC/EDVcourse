Today we will be focusing on the practice of data visualization.

As a reminder, our framework for the workflow of data visualization is shown in @fig-TidyverseFramework

![Tidyverse](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/795c039ba2520455d833b4034befc8cf360a70ba/558a5/diagrams/data-science-explore.png){#fig-TidyverseFramework}

## Geospatial Packages

R has multiple packages that enable geospatial data visualization. Today, we create 
basic maps using the `sf` and `leaflet`.  `sf` stands for ![Simple Features](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) which is an open-source geographic information systems data format that works pretty well with tidyverse. Leaflet is an open-source library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.  

As a reminder, when we first use a package, we need to install it locally.  Let's start by installing both packages. This only needs to be done once.

```{r}
#\ label: installation of leaflet and sf
#\ warning: false
#\ eval: false

install.packages('sf')
install.packages('leaflet')

```

Next, we load the packages to make sure they are available within the R environment. Add in our friend from last session - `tidyverse` 

```{r}
#\ label: installation of leaflet and sf
#\ warning: false


library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)

```

So far, this should be pretty straightforward.  Installing and loading packages is easy.

Now we'll import a test `sf`

```{r}
#\ label: NC dataset?
#\ warning: false

nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))

```

Let's

```{r}

library(tidyverse)


```
