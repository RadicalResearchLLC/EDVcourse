You will also learn the theory and ethics of environmental data visualization.\nI wrote it for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to the R language. Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to practice and apply the skills and judgment of data visualization to provide effective illustrations of real-world data in order to persuade, inform, and communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book is created using the Quarto publishing system in order to provide an example of its use in environmental data visualization and as a course resource tool for easy display of coding examples and visualization."
