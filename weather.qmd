# Weather

The most common environmental dataset that people encounter is the weather. Every major type of media devotes time to the weather: newspapers, [news shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTol-2-Iwio), [apps](https://www.wunderground.com/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/EmojiWeatherUSA?lang=en) [bots](https://twitter.com/laxweatherbot), and [The Weather Channel](https://weather.com/).

It is a great example for us to start talking about environmental data.
