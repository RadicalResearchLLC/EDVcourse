# Sacrifice Zones {#sec-sacrifice}

Today we will focus on the basics of Sacrifice Zones.

## Definition

A **sacrifice zone** is a geographic area permanently impaired by heavy environmental alterations or economic disinvestment, often through locally unwanted land use (LULU). This term is a description of the geographic area where **fenceline communities** live adjacent to pollution sources. These communities are often low-income and disproportionately minority.    

### Fenceline community

A neighborhood that is immediately adjacent to a major source of pollution, such as an industrial facility, military base, major roadway, intermodal facility, port, or airport. Proximity to the emissions source is a key determinant for exposure, but not the only one.

### Risk Assessment

The U.S. EPA has a framework for assessing risk and managing risk. @fig-riskAssess shows a schematic of how that's done.

![Risk Assessment Framework](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-05/image002.jpg){#fig-riskAssess}

Risk assessment has four main steps.

1. Hazard identification - what thing(s) are causing the adverse affects and what adverse effects are they causing? Types of effects include cancer, reproductive, neurological, respiratory, and/or environmental.
2. Dose-response assessment - quantify the toxicity for each chemical for a given adverse outcome
3. Exposure assessment - characterize the amount of chemical in the environment and the exposure routes for individuals (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, dermal) 
4. Risk assessment - Multiply exposure by dose-response across affected populations to get risk estimates.  

After a risk assessment is performed, Risk Management swoops in to decide the way to mitigate risk.  

I don't think this class is likely to do a full-fledged Risk Assessment as part of a Sacrifice Zones project.  This is just background.

### Sacrifice Zone Case Study - [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/series/sacrifice-zones)

This article was a reading assignment earlier in the semester. @fig-proPublica shows the ominous red-gray color-scheme they use throughout.

Let's walk through how they did this analysis using the Tidyverse model of data visualization.

#### Data 

ProPublica used data from the U.S. EPA's [Risk Screening Environmental Indicators](https://www.epa.gov/rsei) model. It includes [Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)](https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program), modeled emissions from a dispersion model called AERMOD, and then dose-response values. It then estimates exposures from individual facilities to nearby grid cells for populations within 49 kilometers from each facility.  

#### Results

ProPublica made really scary maps and showed the worst locations and facilities. EPA provides the whole dataset and shows a [map](https://www.epa.gov/rsei/rsei-results-map) that makes it incredibly difficult to find where the sacrifice zones are. Both groups provide visualizations of the same data, but the stories being told could not be more different.    

#### Discussion

Both the EPA RSEI map and the ProPublica visualizations use the same underlying data. 

* Who is the audience? Are they the same?
* What design choices were made by EPA and ProPublica? 
* Why do they look so different? 
* What is being communicated in the two maps?

#### Air Toxics Dashboard 

Last year, when I started my own business, I made a data dashboard Air Toxics, imaginatively named [Air Toxics Data Dashboard](https://radicalresearch.shinyapps.io/ToxicsDashboard/). It is a technocratic tool, meant to help explore air toxics concentrations from a health risk perspective.  

This isn't really a sacrifice zone dashboard, although it can be used to identify sites with particularly high risk from individual air toxics.  

* Who is the audience?
* What design choices were made to display data?
* Why does this look so different from the EPA and ProPublica visualizations?
* What is being communicated?  

### Project Discussion

* What type of sacrifice zones might be interesting to look at?
* What data do you need to visualize those sacrifice zones?
* Is that data readily available?
