## Definitions of terms

### What is data?

* Facts, or discrete elements of **information**.  
* quantitative or qualitative observations or descriptions
* statistics or values represented in a form suitable for processing by computer

### What is information?  

* The act of informing or the condition of being informed; communication of **knowledge**
* Processed, stored, or transmitted **data**; structured data; data in context and significance
* Stimuli that has meaning in some context for its receiver

* General understanding or familiarity with a subject
* Awareness of a subject; the state of being informed
* Intellectual understanding; the state of appreciating the truth of **information**

## Weather map example

![WeatherMap](images/LATimesWeather.jpg){#fig-WeatherMap}

The visualization structures the underlying data into information. A good visualization communicates complex ideas with clarity, precision, and efficiency.                                        

### Categories of information illustrated by the newspaper weather visualization

* [Quantitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement) (i.e., numerical) data 
  + Temperatures (high, low)
  + Precipitation 
  + Wind speeds and directions
  + Air quality index
  + UV index
  + Tide heights and times
  + Sunrise & sunset times
* [Qualitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research) observations
  + 'Seasonably warm'
  + 'Fog, then mostly sunny'
  + Sky categories (partly cloudy, thunderstorms, rain, sunny, showers, fog, snow, ice)
  + Air quality categories (e.g., unhealthy, moderate)
  + Flood potential
  + Warm front/cold front
  + Low/high pressure
  + dangerous rip currents risk is moderate/low

Why am I calling this **information**, and not _data_ or _insight_? 

Why isn't this course called **Environmental Information Visualization**?
