## Preface {.unnumbered}

This is the course website for **'Environmental Data Visualization'**. In this course,
you will learn to import, manipulate, and visualize data using R, with hands-on 
examples. You will also learn the theory and ethics of environmental data visualization.  
I wrote it for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction to  the R 
language. Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to practice and 
apply the skills and judgment of data visualization to provide effective illustrations
of real-world data in order to persuade, inform, and communicate.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
This book is created using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) publishing system in 
order to provide an example of its use in environmental data visualization and 
as a course resource tool for easy display of coding examples and visualization.
